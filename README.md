> One day, when I was tidying up my room, I came up with an idea for a box management system with various integration options. After many days, I present to you:

Box Master
=====================

This repository contains a Box Master System built with TypeScript. The system is designed to manage a collection of boxes and their relationships, allowing you to add new boxes, delete existing ones, move them, edit them and view them.

Core
----

The `core.ts` file contains the core functionality of the Box Master. It defines the `Box` interface and provides functions for manipulating boxes in the system.

# How to set up

1. The first step is to clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run cleanup`

To start CLI run:
```
npm run cli
```
To start Express API run:
```
npm run api-na
```
You can find documentation in wiki.
